Make sure you have Django installed or use `pip install Django` to install it.

Use `python manage.py runserver` to run the application

In case of any changes or updates execute these commands before running the application:

`python manage.py makemigrations`
`python manage.py migrate`

Further, going through the Django documentation (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/) would be useful to better understand the workflow of a Django application.
